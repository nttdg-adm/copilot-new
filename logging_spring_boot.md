## Logging in Spring Boot using GitHub Copilot
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Lv3-Mature_Best_Practice-brightgreen">](https://github.com/orgs/AI-Native-Development/projects/1/)
 
### Description
Logging in Spring Boot plays a vital role in Spring Boot applications for recording information, actions, and events within the app. It is also used for monitoring the performance of an application, understanding the behavior of the application, and recognizing the issues within the application.

Elements of Logging Framework:-
- Logger: It captures the messages.
- Formatter: It formats the messages which are captured by loggers.
- Handler: It prints messages on the console, stores them in a file or sends an email, etc.

GitHub Copilot can assist with logging in Spring Boot by generating code snippets based on natural language comments or existing code.

### Example

## Input code

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class Example{
    // perform logging using the Logger class from slf4j
     private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Example.class);
     
    public static void main(String[] args) {
          //perform log messages at different levels
            
    
    }
}

```
## Suggestion given by GitHub Copilot
```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class Example{
    // perform logging using the Logger class from slf4j
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Example.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
          //perform log messesages at different levels
            logger.trace("This is a TRACE message.");
            logger.debug("This is a DEBUG message.");
            logger.info("This is an INFO message.");
            logger.warn("This is a WARN message.");
    }

}
```
