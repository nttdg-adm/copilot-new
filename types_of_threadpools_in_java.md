## Types Of ThreadPools in java using GitHub Copilot

### Description
Server Programs such as database and web servers repeatedly execute requests from multiple clients. It consists of a large number of small tasks that create a new thread each time a request arrives. Although this approach seems simple to implement, it has significant drawbacks.
This approach takes more time and may exhaust system memory. So, this necessitates the need to limit the number of threads being created.
A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers a solution to the problem of thread cycle overhead and resource thrashing. 
Thread pool in java is a group of threads that are managed by Executor framework.The Executor framework which is centered around the Executor interface, its sub-interface â€“ExecutorService and the class-ThreadPoolExecutor, which implements both of these interfaces. By using the executor, one only has to implement the Runnable objects and send them to the executor to execute.
The Executor framework provides a way to executes tasks without having to create and manage the threads manually. This helps to improve performance and resource utilization.

Types of Thread Pools:
1. Fixed Thread Pool
2. Cached Thread Pool
3. Scheduled Thread Pool

GitHub Copilot can help you in creating thread pool as per your instructions.
Also, if you have not added import for Executors package or ExecutorService, then you get indicated by editor that there is some error. GitHub Copilot will help you to fix those errors.
#### Example 
- **Exercise 1 - Fixed Thread Pool**
##### Input Code
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
/**
 * FixedThreadPoolExample
 */
public class FixedThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // Create a fixed thread pool with 5 threads
        }
    }
// create a task class that implements Runnable interface
// sleep for 1000 milliseconds
// print the thread name and the task name
```

##### Result Suggested by Copilot

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

/**
 * FixedThreadPoolExample
 */
public class FixedThreadPoolExample {

    public static void main(String[] args){
        // Create a fixed thread pool with 5 threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        // Submit 10 tasks to the executor service
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable worker = new WorkerThread("task" + i);
            executor.execute(worker);
        }
        executor.shutdown();
        
    }
}
// create a task class that implements Runnable interface
// sleep for 1000 milliseconds
// print the thread name and the task name
class WorkerThread implements Runnable {
    private String taskName;
    public WorkerThread(String taskName) {
        this.taskName = taskName;
    }
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " Start. Task = " + taskName);
        processTask();
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " End. Task = " + taskName);
    }
    private void processTask() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
- **Exercise 2 -Cached Thread Pool**
##### Input Code
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
/**
 * CachedThreadPoolExample
 */
public class CachedThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // Create a cached thread pool with 5 threads
        }
    }
// create a task class that implements Runnable interface
// sleep for 1000 milliseconds
// print the thread name and the task name
```

##### Result Suggested by Copilot

```java
/**
 * CachedThreadPoolExample
 */
public class CachedThreadPoolExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a cached thread pool
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
        // Submit 10 tasks to the executor service
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable worker = new WorkerThread("task" + i);
            executor.execute(worker);
        }
        executor.shutdown();

    }
}

// create class which implements Runnable interface
// sleep for 1000 milliseconds
// print the thread name and the task name
class WorkerThread implements Runnable {
    private String taskName;

    public WorkerThread(String taskName) {
        this.taskName = taskName;
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " Start. Task = " + taskName);
        processTask();
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " End. Task = " + taskName);
    }

    private void processTask() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
