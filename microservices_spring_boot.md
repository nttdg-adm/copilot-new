## Microservices in Spring Boot using GitHub Copilot

### Description
Microservices are a modern approach to software whereby application code is delivered in small, manageable pieces, independent of others. Microservices allow large systems to be built up from a number of collaborating components. It does at the process level what Spring has always done at the component level: loosely coupled processes instead of loosely coupled components.

There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming language and use different data storage technologies.

#### Points to remember
 1. These are the services which are exposed by REST.
 2. These are small well-chosen deployable units.
 3. The services must be cloud-enabled.

The microservice defines an approach to the architecture that divides an application into a pool of loosely coupled services that implements business requirements. It is next to **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**. The most important feature of the microservice-based architecture is that it can perform **continuous delivery** of a large and complex application. 

#### Principles of Microservices
There are the following principles of Microservices:

- Single Responsibility principle
- Modelled around business domain
- Isolate Failure
- Infrastructure automation
- Deploy independently

GitHub Copilot can be a helpful tool when working with microservices in Spring Boot. While Copilot itself doesn't specifically focus on microservices, it can assist you in writing code related to microservices by providing suggestions and completing code snippets based on the context you're working in.

### Example
```java
@Controller
public class MyController {
    // Inject the service
    
    // Create a handler method
   
}

@Service
public class MyService {
//   perform required operations

}

```

### Suggested by Github Copilot
```java
@Controller
public class MyController {
    // Inject the service
    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    // Create a handler method
    @RequestMapping("/welcome")
    public String handlerMethod() {
        // Use the service
        myService.doSomething();
        return "welcome";
    }
    
}

@Service
public class MyService {
//   perform required operations
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Inside doSomething() method of MyService");
    }

}


```
