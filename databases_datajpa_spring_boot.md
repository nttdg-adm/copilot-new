### Description
Relational databases for Spring Boot applications include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

Spring Boot makes it easy to work with databases. By using Spring Boot, you can connect to a variety of databases and use Spring Data JPA to access the database. Spring Boot can be used to connect to a variety of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. 

**When to use**: If your application requires strong data consistency, ACID transactions, and well-defined relationships between data entities, a relational database like MySQL may be the best choice.

### How to create a database in Spring Boot?
Step-by-Step Spring Boot Project Update

- Step 1 - Add dependency for your database connector to pom. xml. ...
- Step 2 - Remove H2 Dependency from pom.xml. Or atleast make its scope as test. ...
- Step 3 - Setup your My SQL Database. ...
- Step 4 - Setup your database connection. ...
- Step 5 - Restart, and you're done! ...
- Just Released.

**Java Persistence API (JPA)** is a standard interface for accessing databases in Java, providing an automatic mapping between Java classes and database tables.

GitHub Copilot can assist in understanding Spring Boot by generating code snippets and suggestion based on natural language. This can be helpful for tasks like defining entities, repositories, and query methods in a more intuitive manner, making it easier to grasp the Spring JPA concepts.

### Example

## Input Code
```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class index {
    // // perfrom SpringJPA operations to add user
    
    
}
```

## Result Suggested by Copilot
```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class index {
    // perfrom SpringJPA operations to add user
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String index() {
        User user = new User();
        user.setName("John");
        user.setRole("Admin");
        userRepository.save(user);
        return "User added";
    }
}
```
