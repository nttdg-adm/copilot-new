## JUnit Testing in Spring Boot using GitHub Copilot

### Description
JUnit is a framework that allows you to call a method and verify (or assert) that the result is as anticipated. It allows developers to write tests in Java and run them on the Java platform. JUnit also has a built-in reporter that can print out the results of the tests.

There are two main goals of automation testing with JUnit:-
1. The first goal is to ensure that the software is doing what it's supposed to do. If a piece of code is supposed to do something and it doesn't, you want to know about that as quickly as possible so you can fix it.
2. The second goal of automation testing with JUnit is to find errors in your code; if you encounter problems with the way your code works, remember the golden rule: remove bugs before they can be fixed!

JUnit provides several features that make it easy to create and run tests, including:

- **Assertions**: Assertions are used to verify the expected behavior of a system. JUnit provides a set of assertion methods that can be used to check the results of a test.
- **Test runners**: Test runners are used for executing the tests and reporting the results. JUnit provides a graphical test runner that can run tests and view the results.
- **Test suites**: Test suites are used to group related tests. JUnit provides a way to create test suites that can be run together.‚Äç
- **Reporting**: When you run your tests, JUnit can help you analyze the results. It provides a built-in reporter that prints out information about the executed tests.

GitHub Copilot can assist with JUnit testing in Spring Boot by generating code snippets that demonstrate common test patterns. For example, if you're writing a test for a Spring Boot application using JUnit, Copilot can provide suggestions for setting up test classes, defining test methods, and creating assertions.

### Example

## Input Code
```java
@SpringBootTest
public class MyServiceTest {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    @Test
    public void testAdd() {
//  perform the Arrange part of the test
      
//  perform the Act part of the test
       
//  perform the Assert part of the test
      
    }
}
```

## Result Suggested by Copilot
```java
@SpringBootTest
public class MyServiceTest {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    @Test
    public void testAdd() {
//  perform the Arrange part of the test
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;

//  perform the Act part of the test
        int result = myService.add(a, b);
        
//  perform the Assert part of the test
        assertEquals(30, result);

    }
}
```
